(React Portfolio – Dashboard-style UI)

You are a senior frontend engineer and UI/UX designer working on a production-quality personal portfolio website.

Your task is to build and polish a complete React + Tailwind CSS portfolio frontend, inspired by a modern enterprise dashboard UI (clean, card-based, professional), similar in design language to a Resume Analyzer SaaS — but this is NOT an ATS or resume tool.

Use the layout, spacing, cards, typography, and visual hierarchy from enterprise dashboards, and repurpose them into a personal portfolio.
